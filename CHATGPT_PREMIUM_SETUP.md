# Using ChatGPT Premium API Key for Fast Responses

## Quick Setup Guide

### Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key

Even though you have ChatGPT Premium, you need a **separate API key** for API access:

1. **Go to OpenAI Platform:**
   - Visit: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Sign in with the **same account** you use for ChatGPT Premium

2. **Create API Key:**
   - Click "Create new secret key"
   - Give it a name (e.g., "Desktop App")
   - Copy the key immediately (starts with `sk-...`)
   - ⚠️ **Important:** You can only see it once!

3. **Check Your Credits:**
   - Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
   - Make sure you have API credits available
   - ChatGPT Premium subscription ≠ API credits (they're separate)

### Step 2: Use in the App

1. **Open Settings** (⚙ button in top-right)
2. **Select "OpenAI (ChatGPT)"** as vendor
3. **Paste your API key** (the one starting with `sk-`)
4. **Click "Save API Key"**
5. **Start using!**

## Speed Optimizations Applied

The app is now optimized for **maximum speed**:

✅ **Using `gpt-4o-mini`** - Fastest OpenAI model  
✅ **Reduced max tokens** (500) - Faster responses  
✅ **Optimized streaming** - Shows responses as they arrive  
✅ **Fast chunk processing** - Immediate UI updates

## Model Comparison (Speed)

| Model | Speed | Quality | Cost |
|-------|-------|---------|------|
| **gpt-4o-mini** | ⚡⚡⚡ Fastest | Good | Low |
| gpt-4o | ⚡⚡ Fast | Excellent | Medium |
| gpt-4-turbo | ⚡ Medium | Excellent | High |

The app uses **gpt-4o-mini** by default for the best speed/quality balance.

## Troubleshooting

### "API key not working"
- Make sure you copied the **entire key** (no spaces)
- Check if you have API credits at https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
- Try regenerating the key

### "Still slow"
- Check your internet connection
- API response time depends on:
  - Your location (distance to OpenAI servers)
  - Network speed
  - API load at that moment
- Try shorter queries for faster responses

### "Quota exceeded"
- Check your usage: https://platform.openai.com/usage
- Add credits: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
- Or switch to Gemini/Perplexity (free options)

2. **Be specific** - Clear questions get faster answers
3. **Use gpt-4o-mini** - Already set as default (fastest)
4. **Good internet** - Faster connection = faster responses
5. **Avoid images** - Text-only queries are fastest
